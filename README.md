# Complex Function 

## aboute this project

This project is about Polynoms and polynomial Complex Functions, creating and handling them in Java, including some useful functions (Drawing, Computing area, etc..) described in the wiki pages.
The main purpose of my project is to visually draw polynomial functions
  

* Monom Functions: Represents Mathematical Monom in Object Oriented programming in the form of ax^b where a is a (double) real number and b(int) is a natural number. The monom class has two objects, the coefficiant and the power of the monom.

* Polynom Functions: Represents Mathematical Polynom in Object Oriented programming in the form of a_1X^b_1 + a_2X^b_2 ... a_nXb_n, which is consisted of ArrayList collection of Monoms.

* Compex Function: Represents Mathematical Complex Function in the form of (operation(operation(operation,operation),function),function) and so on. Complex Function Class is built with three Objects: a. Left-The Left Function. b. Right-The Right Function. c. The Operation (OP).

* FunctionGUI: This class is able to representing a collection of functions that can be saved to a file, be read from a file, and displayed in GUI form using STDDraw. FunctionGUI is consisted of Arraylist collections representing a function of the three mentioned above.
